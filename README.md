    The CRC operation is useful for error checking data. Errors can be randomly created in transmitted  data due to electromagnetic interference in the transmission medium. These errors corrupt the transmitted data. We can't necessarily correct these errors. However, we can check to see if an error has occurred. To do this, CRC error checking is one such method. 

    CRC error checking is a popular method because of its effectiveness, and ease of implementation. A good CRC can catch literally billions of errors. Likewise, the operations necessary for CRC error checking can be implemented using simple state machines.
